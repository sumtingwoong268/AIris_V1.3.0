## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Update Supabase
```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
# Run: supabase/setup.sql
```

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables
```bash
# Create/update .env file:
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=eyJhbG...
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...  # Get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
```

### Step 3: Restart Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
bun run dev
```

### Step 4: Test Everything
1. Create new account → Should go to Setup page
2. Complete setup form → Should save all fields
3. Toggle dark mode → Should persist on refresh
4. Upload avatar → Should work in Setup & Profile
5. Complete tests → XP should not duplicate
6. Generate report → Should use OpenAI (if key present)
7. View statistics → Should show all test history

---

## 🐛 Known Remaining Issues

1. **Other tests need XP duplication fix** (ReadingStressTest, AmslerTest, VisualAcuityTest)
2. **XP scaling** only applied to Ishihara (others still at original values)
3. **Git push authentication** - Changes committed locally but not pushed
4. **Profile page** - Should show all new setup fields for editing

---

## 🎯 How to Complete Remaining Tasks

### Apply XP fix to other tests:
```typescript
// In each test file, add:
const [submitting, setSubmitting] = useState(false);

// In submit function:
if (!user || submitting) return;
setSubmitting(true);
// ... existing code ...
finally {
  setSubmitting(false);
}

// Scale XP:
const xpEarned = Math.round(40 * (score / 100)); // Acuity
const xpEarned = Math.round(35 * (score / 100)); // Amsler
const xpEarned = Math.round(30 * (score / 100)); // Reading Stress
```

### Push to GitHub:
```bash
# Generate GitHub personal access token
# Then:
git remote set-url origin https://<TOKEN>@github.com/sumtingwoong268/AIris_V1.3.0.git
git push origin vast-stone-637
```
